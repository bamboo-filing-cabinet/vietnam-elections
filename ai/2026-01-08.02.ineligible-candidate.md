## Follow-up: Ineligible candidate handling (e.g., Trần Văn Nam)

### Context
- VTV report indicates one winning candidate (Trần Văn Nam, Bình Dương) was not confirmed to take the seat.
- Current pipeline stores overall summary counts (confirmed/unconfirmed) but does not tag a specific candidate.

### Goals
- Record candidate-level caveats in a structured, extensible way.
- Support future cycles with similar cases (disqualifications, resignations, recounts, etc.).

### Open questions (need your answers)
Answered:
- Use **election_result_candidate** with a new status field (result-level).
- Use an **attribute-style** approach (e.g., `election_result_candidate_attribute`).
- Show caveat in the **results table first** (candidate detail later).
- **Yes**, VTV report should be the authoritative source.

### Proposed schema direction (draft)
Revised direction:
- Add `election_result_candidate_annotation` linked to `election_result_candidate`.
- Store `status` (e.g., `not_confirmed`) + `reason` + `effective_date` + `source_document_id`.
- Embed annotations inside `results.json` under each record’s `annotations` array (UI: results only for now).

### Milestones (approval required to advance)

#### Milestone A: Schema + ingest
- Implement `election_result_candidate_annotation` table and loader from VTV report.
- Add VTV report as a `document` and link to the attribute via `source_document_id`.

#### Milestone B: Exports
- Add `candidate_outcomes.json` export.
- Optionally embed `status` in `results.json` records.

#### Milestone C: UI
- Add status badge/annotation in results table and candidate detail page.
- Show source card for the caveat.

## Milestone A progress
- Added `election_result_candidate_annotation` table and loader for VTV report.
- VTV report added as a document and linked to the annotation.

## Milestone B progress
- Embedded annotations array inside `results.json` per record.

## Milestone C progress
- Results table now shows status badges with tooltip details.
- Candidate detail page now shows results summary and annotations with sources.
- Candidate results section moved to the top card; sources listed in the Sources section.
- Candidate sources section now mirrors constituency source grouping.

## Next step (awaiting your answers + approval)
- Confirm approval to proceed with Milestone A (schema + ingest).
